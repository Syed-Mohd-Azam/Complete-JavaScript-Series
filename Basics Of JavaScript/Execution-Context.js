// Execution Context

// Everything in JavaScript happens inside the Execution Context.Execution Context is like a container and it contains two components --> Variable Environment and Thread of Execution.

// Memory Component --> This is the environment where all the variables and functions of a program are stored. Here, all the variables and functions are stored in the key value pairs.This is also known as Variable Environment.

// Code Component --> This is the environment where the code of a program is executed. This component is also called as Thread of Execution.

// JavaScript is a single threaded and synchronous language

// JavaScript is a single threaded language, it means that it will execute one instruction at a time. Once that instruction is executed, then it will execute another instruction after previous instruction.

// JavaScript is a synchronous language, it means that it will execute the instruction in a specific order.It will maintain the order, it cannot execute the instruction randomly, or it cannot execute the instruction which takes less that time over that instruction which takes higher time.

// Call Stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts.
