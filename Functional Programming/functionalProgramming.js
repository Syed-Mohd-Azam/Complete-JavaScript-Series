// Functional Programming is a programming paradigm designed to handle functions in a better way in JS (mainly pure functions).
// JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language.We can use object-oriented,procedural and functional programming paradigms all at the same time in JavScript.
// Functional Programming has a few important concepts that we need to know and understand. By implementing these concepts in your applications, you will end up with more functional code. This will make a huge difference in your application making it more readable, usable and maintainable.

// Key features of functional Programming

// Imperative and Declarative way of writing code.
// Pure functions and side effects.
// Higher Order Functions.
// Composition
// Closures
// Currying
