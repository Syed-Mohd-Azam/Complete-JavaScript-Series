// Similar to variable, an array also stores data but it is used to store multiple data items.
// It enables storing multiple values under same variable name and we can perform various operations on them by using different methods and properties also every value gets a sequential index starting at 0.
// In JavScript, arrays can store values of different types whereas in statically typed language array will store such type of values, that type a arry has.
